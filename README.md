# Fourier-Neural-Operators-
The aim of this project is to compare the predictive performance and computational efficiency of  Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) with those of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), followed by a full deep dive into tuning the hyperparameters of our FNO to produce the best results with the equipment at hand.
